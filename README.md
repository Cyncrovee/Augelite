# QnA
## Is it ready for daily use?
No. Augelite is very unstable at this point and I would NOT recommend using it as a primary text editor.
## Can I Contribute?
Yes! Feel free to make an issue or pull request, as long as it is not AI generated, and is your own work or properly licensed work that is compatible with the project. I'd also prefer that you use the [codeberg repository](https://codeberg.org/Cyncrovee/Augelite) if possible.
